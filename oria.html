Throughout my journey in iamthecode, I achieved 41 certificates by completing all the modules. When I look at my certificates, I feel proud and motivated because they show the time and effort I gave to learning. Each certificate reminds me of the challenges I faced and how I was able to overcome them by not giving up and by practicing more. This experience helped me improve my skills in technology, increased my confidence, and encouraged me to continue learning more about computers and digital skills in the future.

One of my achievements is gaining knowledge in different coding languages. This helped me understand how programs work and how coding is used in technology. It improved my problem-solving skills and made me more confident when using computers. I also learned how to follow instructions and think step by step when writing code. This experience encouraged me to continue learning more about coding and digital skills in the future and helped prepare me for my studies and career in the TVL track.

The iamthecode meeting was a meaningful experience for me because it helped me understand the purpose of the program and the importance of learning digital skills. It also taught me how coding and technology can open opportunities for students like me and how these skills can be useful in the future. The meeting inspired me to work harder, stay focused, and practice what I learned so I can improve my knowledge and be more confident in using technology.        </p>

This picture of us participating in our school’s club booth was a fun and valuable experience for me. In the booth, we sold sweets like marshmallows and Stick-O, and I enjoyed helping customers and seeing them happy with our products. Working with my classmates to set up and organize the booth.

This picture was taken when we were completing all the modules in iamthecode. I have finished all the modules in the computer laboratory, and I feel really proud of myself. Completing all the tasks showed me how much I have learned about computers and technology. Some modules were challenging, but by practicing and staying focused, I was able to understand them and finish on time.
