      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
I’m Nor-ainie E. Benito, 17 years old and living in Barangay Culiat, Quezon City. I am a Grade 12 HUMSS student at Culiat High School. My favorite thing to do is figure out things I haven't mastered yet—I love the feeling of finally "getting" something that used to be a mystery to me.     </p>

My First Achievement was that initial feeling of belonging. Even though I started with no background in tech, receiving the official confirmation and my account details in my Gmail made it real. Knowing that I was officially part of this community gave me the push I needed to start learning.

My Second Achievement was successfully finishing the HTML course in Percipio and earning my first certificate. For someone who had never seen a line of code before, figuring out how it all works and getting that recognition was a huge confidence booster. It taught me that I don't need to be an expert to start; I just need to be willing to learn.

My third achievement was a real test of my perseverance. At one point, we actually thought the program wasn't going to continue. I had already started on the first 4 modules when things felt uncertain, but our coordinator told us to keep going anyway. Once it was later confirmed that the program was officially ongoing, I didn't waste a second. I pushed through and finished the rest of the 12 modules in a very short span of time. Completing everything under that kind of pressure showed me that I can handle any challenge as long as I keep moving forward.

This photo takes me back to our second meeting when our coordinator selected the club officers. To be honest, I felt a wave of pressure when I was chosen. As a HUMSS student, I’m more used to studying human behavior and social issues than technical systems. There are moments when I wonder if I’m truly the most dependable person for this role, but I’ve learned that leadership isn't about being perfect. Even on days when I can’t give my full energy, I make sure to give the absolute best I can. I want to be someone my team can truly rely on.     </div>

For this photo is from our very first coding session. I’ll be the first to admit that staring at those courses was intimidating at first. In the HUMSS strand, we learn that communication is the key to changing society—and that day, I realized that coding is just another way to speak to the world. It’s a tool that allows us to build solutions for real people. Even though the technical side is a challenge, it’s worth it because I know these skills will help me advocate for others in the future.

This photo shows us, the officers, during our official oath-taking at Culiat High School. That moment made everything feel real. Taking that pledge wasn't just a ceremony; it was a promise to our community. Standing there with my fellow officers, I realized that we are bridging the gap between social awareness and digital innovation. We aren't just learning to code for ourselves; we are learning to lead so we can create a more inclusive and connected world for everyone.
