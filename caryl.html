      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
         I'm Caryl Andrea C. Alo! I'm 17 years old and live in Barangay Culiat, Quezon City, and currently taking Humanities and Social Sciences strand. I love binge-watching K-Dramas and Movies, and I make sure my schedule is always perfectly organized. And I want to become an architect and build amazing spaces!

        My first achievement was "Learn to Code in HTML" because this is the first coding I did. At first, it was difficult. There were so many symbols you had to put in for your work to be correct. But as the time goes by, my skills improved and I can do it properly.

      <div class="gallery-item">
        <img src="caryl achi 2.jpg" alt="Accomplishment 2" />
        <p>
          This is my second achievement for me, because before I only wished that I could make it to rank 10, while doing the tasks and watching the lesson videos I was shocked, because I found myself at rank 5 already. This is such a huge achievement for me because from the start, I knew deep down that I might not be able to handle it since the tasks were mostly coding-focused, but luckily, I managed to do it properly.

        <p>
          And lastly, was seeing my achievements and progress is surprising. At first, June July I was very lazy to do the task and watching video lesson because it was summer break that time so what I did throughout the entire summer break was just play and play I didn't even care to do the task in the iamthecode. When November comes I've already completed more tasks. I didn't even notice that I have 32 badges, 42 certificates, and 83 completions. Maybe my goal back in November was to finish this, while learning in every task and in the video lesson.

            In this picture, when we gathered for a meeting to check if we had any progress yet, I still had no progress during those days. So I joined in answering the pre-test for module 3, and I got so many wrong answers. We also made plans there—Our president said it would be better to take the pre-test before proceeding to the module. They shared a lot of tips for us, and I applied all those tips when I took the module. I remembered the answers we discussed during our meeting, so I was able to correct my answers, And I passed the test.

            In this picture, when Ma’am Terry was helping me to open my account in other devices, because my account can't open to other devices except my cellphone. I can't do some coding task that required a laptop/computer, I was very sad that time because some of the members is doing their task and I feel like I was being left behind. But in the end, I found a device that my account has been opened. I've done some coding parts and also video lesson.
