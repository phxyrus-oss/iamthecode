      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
I am John Lonil B. Mendoza, a 17-year-old student currently enrolled in the Technical-Vocational-Livelihood (TVL) strand at Culiat High School. I live in Luzon Avenue and have a strong interest in computers and technology. I enjoy learning new things that help me develop my skills and prepare for my future career.

One of my major achievements was completing the Learn to Code in CSS course. Since it was my first time learning coding, I found the lab activities difficult at first. Despite the challenges, I was able to complete the course through continuous learning and guidance. This achievement helped me understand the role of CSS in website design, especially in improving layout, colors, and overall appearance.

        <p>
Another important achievement was the knowledge I gained throughout my learning journey. Although I learned only basic coding concepts, such as simple programs and commands, these lessons gave me a strong foundation. This knowledge will help me in my future course, and I am determined to continue improving my coding skills.    </p>

        <p>
Lastly, completing all the modules and activities in the I Am the Code program was a meaningful achievement for me. It helped me strengthen my understanding of coding concepts while developing patience, discipline, and teamwork. Collaborating with my classmates allowed me to learn from others and overcome challenges together, which inspired me to continue learning more about technology.</p>

This photo was taken during the time when we were allowed to borrow mini laptops provided by the school. These devices played an important role in helping us begin our journey with the modules of IAMTHECODE. Having access to these mini laptops made our learning more convenient and hands-on, since we were able to follow the modules directly, practice activities, and explore new concepts in coding and technology. This experience marked the starting point of our growth in digital skills and encouraged us to become more confident and motivated learners.          </p>

In this picture, this is where we help each other while working on the IAMTHECODE module by sharing ideas, assisting classmates who encounter difficulties, and explaining steps that may be confusing. Through teamwork and cooperation, we are able to complete tasks more efficiently and better understand the lessons, especially in coding activities that require problem solving and focus. This experience highlights the importance of collaboration and communication in developing our computer and technology skills.

In this picture, we built up a booth representing the IAMTHECODE club where we worked together to prepare and organize the materials, decorate the area, and present our club to other students. This activity allowed us to showcase the purpose of IAMTHECODE, promote interest in coding and technology, and strengthen teamwork among members. Through setting up the booth, we learned how to cooperate, communicate effectively, and take responsibility, while also building confidence in representing our club and sharing our knowledge with others.          </p>
