I have obtained 41 certificates. I am very happy with my progress and I will continue to do more not for the sake of having more certificates but to gain more knowledge.

In this image, we did a lot of modules together. We watched and learned many things in programming, some concepts were similar to other coding languages so it wasn’t hard to figure out. Coding is truly amazing.

          <p>
I have learned a lot in the iamtheCODE program. This opportunity has given me a lot of experience regarding programming. Many coding lessons aren’t taught for free so I am very thankful for this opportunity. This entire journey was very fun, and exciting.

          <p>
Lastly, completing all the modules and activities in the I Am the Code program was a meaningful achievement for me. It helped me strengthen my understanding of coding concepts while developing patience, discipline, and teamwork. Collaborating with my classmates allowed me to learn from others and overcome challenges together, which inspired me to continue learning more about technology.</p>
