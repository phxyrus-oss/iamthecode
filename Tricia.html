      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
My name is Tricia Mae C. Macaraeg and I'm 17 years old living in Barangay Culiat. I am a grade 12 student taking Humanities in Social Sciences strand at Culiat High School. I love to discover new things, watch movies and k-dramas, and organize things! I'd like to become a nurse or psychologist someday. It's nice meeting you!    </p>

The first achievement that I received was completing the HMTL course. Doing the labs activity greatly helped me to further comprehend the course. I realized that putting what you've learned into practice is a way to fully grasp it. I considered this an achievement because I truly struggled to understand the learning videos at first.            </p>

        <p>
My second achievement was that I was able to finish almost all of the modules in one month. I never really thought that I would be able to finish the modules because, as I mentioned, I am really not that into coding. My commitment and perseverance were the main reasons behind my completion. I've realized that as long as you trust the process, you will be able to find the beauty of it, even if it's not something you initially enjoy.</p>

        <p>
Lastly, my third achievement was that I was able to gain new knowledge throughout this journey and is now capable of making a website. I'm very grateful to all of the people that helped me along the way and made me experience this kind of journey. In the end, I realized that sometimes, venturing in things that you're not familiar with could further sharpen your skills and help you in improving yourself.</p>

In this picture, we gathered after school to start finishing the modules together. We helped and supported each other in doing our Iamthecode activities. Through this, I learned how important support is in achieving better results. It made me realize that learning something is much more fun when you do it with someone.

This photo was taken during the second meeting of the Iamthecode members. On that day, we discussed all of our plans in our club and as well as cooperated with one another in answering an activity in Iamthecode. This moment helped us grow our sense of collaboration and strengthen our bond as a team.

As seen in this photo, I was trying to do the labs in HMTL. This was my first time trying the HMTL lab activity because it requires the use of a laptop.  Doing the actual coding was much harder than I expected, but with the help of the step-by-step instructions provided by the app itself, it became easier. Through this, I was able to comprehend more of the lessons in HMTL.
