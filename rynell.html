      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Rynell Adian T. Cristobal, I am 17 years old and currently studying at Culiat High School. I am a student learner of the Iamthecode program. I joined this program to gain new knowledge, improve my skills, and challenge myself in learning new things related to technology.

          At first, joining the Iamthecode program was challenging for me because some lessons were new and unfamiliar. I had a hard time understanding them at the beginning, but as I continued watching the learning videos and doing the activities, I slowly learned and improved.

        <p>
          My second achievement was completing many learning activities and staying consistent in the program. Even when it was difficult, I still pushed myself to finish what I started.

          Lastly, my third achievement was gaining new knowledge and skills that I can use in the future. Through this program, I realized that with determination and patience, I can overcome challenges and achieve my goals.

            In this picture, our IamtheCODE Club set up a booth in our school to promote our organization and its purpose. We worked together to prepare materials, explain our activities, and interact with other students. This experience helped us improve our communication skills and teamwork. It also made me feel proud to represent our club and share how technology can be used in creative and meaningful ways.

            In this picture, our club took part in an Anti-Bullying Campaign alongside other students. This activity showed that IamtheCODE is not only focused on coding but also on advocating for positive values such as respect and kindness. Being involved in this campaign made me realize how important it is to stand up against bullying and use our voice to support a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.

            In this picture, the members of IamtheCODE gathered for a meeting and group discussion. We shared ideas, listened to one another, and planned future activities for the club. This gathering strengthened our bond as a team and helped us grow both academically and personally. Through these moments, I learned the importance of collaboration, leadership, and supporting one another as a club.
