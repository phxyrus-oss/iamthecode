Seeing all my certificates fills me with a sense of accomplishment and motivation. The variety of topics, from programming to project management and communication, reflects my eagerness to learn beyond my comfort zone. These certificates serve as a reminder that I am developing skills that will benefit my future studies and career.        </p>

Seeing myself ranked 46th on the leaderboard with 65 completions makes me feel proud and motivated. Despite facing challenges like limited learning days and sometimes being unable to access my account, I persevered and completed the modules. This shows that my hard work and consistency on iAMTHECODE are paying off. Knowing I am improving on the leaderboard pushes me to keep learning and stay disciplined. This achievement reminds me that even with school responsibilities and obstacles, I can still perform well if I remain focused and committed.        </p>

The learning days by month show how my study habits improved over time. At first, I had limited learning days, and sometimes I didn’t have enough time to open the modules because my account couldn’t always be accessed. Despite these challenges, I kept trying and managed to complete the modules. As the months progressed, especially in November, I became more consistent. This reflects my growing commitment to self-improvement and better time management. Seeing my 31 badges, 37 certificates, and 71 completions makes me realize how much effort I have invested in my learning journey. Each badge and certificate represents skills I gained and challenges I overcame. These achievements boost my confidence and motivate me to keep learning, knowing that my hard work is turning into real accomplishments I can be proud of.        </p>

This photo was taken in the computer laboratory during a meeting of our club, iAMTHECODE. We gathered to work on our tasks and continue our learning modules. As the club president, I took the initiative to help my classmates and schoolmates by guiding them on how to do the activities properly and assisting them in finishing some of their modules. The meeting was productive and showed teamwork, cooperation, and our commitment to learning together.

In this picture, our IamtheCODE Club is having a meeting in the ComLab to work on our modules. Our club head teacher kindly provided us with Jollibee while we collaborated. This experience helped us improve our teamwork and made me proud to be part of a club where we can learn and create together.

In this picture, our IamtheCODE Club set up a booth at our school for the Teacher’s Day event to promote our organization and its mission. We worked together to prepare materials, explain our activities, interact with other students, and sell marshmallows. This experience helped us enhance our communication skills and teamwork. It also made me proud to represent our club and show how technology can be used in creative and meaningful ways.
