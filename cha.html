Being an iamthecode teacher facilitator has been a challenging but meaningful learning journey for me. Through this role, I have learned something new in my profession and this is how to code.      </p>

          <p>
Learning the basic skills of coding really challenged me at first, but it also reminded me what it feels like to be a learner, which helped me become more patient and encouraging in the classroom.          </p>

Overall, being an iamthecode teacher facilitator has strengthened my professional growth. It allowed me to learn new skills while empowering students to explore coding and believe in their abilities. This experience has shown me that teaching and learning can grow together.        </p>
