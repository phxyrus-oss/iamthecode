      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
Hi, my name is Bernnadeth Jane M. Estacio. I am currently a grade 12 ABM (Accountancy, Business, and Management) student at Culiat High School. I am 17 years old and currently living in Barangay Culiat. I love reading fiction stories on Wattpad, writing my own stories, and watching K-dramas. I also enjoy serving as a reader and being part of the youth leadership at our church. I am the oldest daughter among my siblings, so they always have high expectations of me. I am also one of the officers of IamtheCode at Culiat High School. In the future, I want to be either a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) or a Math/Science teacher.

One of my main achievements here in IamtheCode is that I was just picked to be one of the officers in IamtheCode. I am not happy because of the position I have; I am happy because our adviser in the code trusts me in a specific position, even though I know I am not knowledgeable in computers. I accepted it because I know I will learn everything, and they will help me to achieve it.        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="gallery-item">
        <img src="berna achi 2.jpg" alt="Accomplishment 2" />
        <p>
This was the second meeting we had. I learned, and I socialized with others. For me, this was the biggest achievement because as a first-timer in coding, I didn't know everything. I didn't know how to use and manipulate everything in coding, but with the help of my co-coders, I learned, and the next day I did coding on my own.
        </p>

      <div class="gallery-item">
        <img src="berna achi 3.jpg" alt="Accomplishment 3" />
        <p>
The last thing of my achievement is we did our successful first meeting in Iamthecode. At first I was afraid to make a mistake and made a wrong mode in my module. Sometimes I've always been asking my fellow students, and I am thankful because they are helping me. This was a very important achievement also, because this was the first time working together, because at first I was always working on my module on my own, so I had a lot of time to relax, and no time was running.

        <div class="exp-text">
          
          <p>
My journey in IamtheCode isn't as good as I expected, because as a graduating student I need to manage a lot of responsibilities, but when I start doing my modules I am thankful because I expect nothing, but here I am, a woman with coding skills. Yes, I am not knowledgeable like others, but I am proud of myself because I learned to do it, and I handled all the responsibilities. 
            </p>

      <div class="exp-item">

        <div class="exp-text">
          
          <p>
At first, I am not enjoying my IamtheCode journey, because for me it's nonsense since it isn't aligned to my Strand (ABM), and this is far from my course in college (CPA/Educ), but in the end, I realized this is very helpful. Not just because I gained knowledge with my coding, but instead because I had an opportunity to meet this world, which made me realize this journey is very helpful, because I am in a generation where we are always using technology.          </p>

      <div class="exp-item">

        <div class="exp-text">
          
          <p>
So that, I am thankful for IamtheCode, because they give us an opportunity to meet the computer world, to experience how memorable it is, and to learn how to enjoy it while learning it.
