      According to United Nations and UNESCO data, millions of children and adolescents worldwide
      are not achieving basic literacy skills. Approximately <strong>617 million students</strong>
      do not reach minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics. This includes around <strong>387 million primary school-age children</strong>
      and <strong>230 million adolescents of lower secondary school age</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This indicates a serious global learning crisis: being enrolled in school does not guarantee
      students are learning the foundational skills needed for future success.

  <h2>The Digital Divide in Education</h2>
  <p>
 Millions of learners worldwide still lack access to home computers, tablets, or reliable internet connections. 
    This digital divide creates significant barriers to education, limiting students’ ability to participate in 
    distance learning, access online resources, and develop essential digital literacy skills. The gap is especially 
    pronounced in low-income countries, rural areas, and communities affected by socio-economic disadvantage. 
    As education increasingly relies on digital tools, addressing this divide is critical to ensuring equitable 
    learning opportunities and achieving the goals of SDG 4.  </p>

  <h2>Out‑of‑School Children and Youth</h2>
  <p>
    Despite decades of progress in expanding access to education, hundreds of millions of children and
    adolescents remain out of school. According to the UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report,
    approximately <strong>251 million children and youth</strong> worldwide were not enrolled in school,
    with the highest rates in low‑income regions and areas affected by conflict and poverty. This
    persistent exclusion from education highlights ongoing barriers to achieving universal quality
    education under SDG 4.

  <h2>Girls and Gender Inequality in Education</h2>
  <p>
    Gender inequality continues to be one of the most persistent barriers to achieving <strong>quality education for all</strong>. 
    Globally, nearly two-thirds of all illiterate adults are women, highlighting the ongoing disparities in access to education 
    between girls and boys. Socio-economic barriers, cultural norms, and limited opportunities in disadvantaged regions prevent 
    many girls from enrolling in school, completing their education, or developing essential literacy and numeracy skills. 
    Additionally, girls often face higher dropout rates due to early marriage, household responsibilities, or lack of safe and 
    inclusive learning environments, further reinforcing the gender gap in education.

 IamtheCODE club helps reduce the digital divide by lending free laptops and devices to students who do not have access to computers at home. Through its coding clubs and learning programs, learners are able to borrow these devices to practice programming, complete projects, and participate in digital learning activities. This initiative ensures that lack of technology does not prevent students from developing essential coding and digital skills. By providing hands-on access to tools needed for learning, IamtheCODE creates a more inclusive environment where all learners can engage in technology-based education.

  Despite improved access to education, some children in nearby communities remain out of school.
  To address this, the iamtheCODE club adviser at Culiat High School conducts outreach in the Muslim
  compound to encourage families to enroll their children. This direct engagement helps bring
  out-of-school youth back into formal education and supports the school’s commitment to inclusive
